# Spring MVC

1. Configure Spring MVC and DB(in `db.properties` file). Adding Spring dependencies use the same version for each of them.
For this purpose you can use property `spring.version`.
3. Create UserResponseDto with all fields of User in `dto` package. 
Also, you should add default constructor explicitly if you'll decide to create new ones. 
4. Create UserController in ``controller`` package where you should
    - implement method ```GET: /users/inject``` which will create test data. Let's create three users in this method and save them to DB:
   
      firstName  | lastName
      ------------- | -------------
      John  | Doe
      Emily  | Stone
      Hugh  | Dane
    - method ```UserResponseDto get(Long userId)```, URL: ```GET: /users/{userId} ```. This method should return information about user by user id.
    - method ```List<UserResponseDto> getAll```, URL: ```GET: /users```. This method should return information about all users from DB.

In response let's return the message ``Users are injected!``

4. Create a `UserMapper` in `service` package, where we're gonna perform all mapping to/from DTOs in order to stick with SRP. Use will use this mapper on the controller layer.

4. Run tests with command `mvn -DskipTests=false clean package`.
